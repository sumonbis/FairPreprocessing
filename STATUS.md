# Badges

We apply for the three badges *available*, *functional*, and *reusable*. Here are the reasons why we believe that the artifact deserves the badges.

### Available
The artifact is publicly shared in the GitHub repository: `https://github.com/sumonbis/FairPreprocessing.git`.
Furthermore, a DOI is obtained for the latest release:
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/371777846.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/371777846)

### Functional
We provided detailed instructions for installation, environment setup, and run the benchmark. Furthermore we shared the following necessary components of the artifact:

* We shared all the datasets to run the machine learning tasks.
* The runable benchmark is shared.
* All the code for implementing the approach are shared.
* All our experiments are functional, which automatically produces results in CSV files.

### Reusable
Along with the experiments, we shared all the data that can be used to reproduce the results in the paper. Furthermore, to automate the experiments, we created shell scripts. Our artifact is annotated and well documented.
